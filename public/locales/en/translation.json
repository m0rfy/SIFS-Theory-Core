    "subtitle": "Scale-Invariant Fractal Spacetime — Unification of physics through fractal geometry",
    "main_title": "🌌 About SIFS Theory",
    "description_prefix": "Scale-Invariant Fractal Spacetime (SIFS)",
    "description_body": "— is a unified geometric field theory that combines gravity, quantum mechanics, and cosmology through the fractal geometry of 5-dimensional spacetime. The theory solves fundamental problems of modern physics: mass hierarchy, the nature of dark energy, proton stability, and the black hole information paradox.",
    "main_idea_title": "🎯 Main Idea",
    "main_idea_text1": "Our 4D universe is a 3-brane in a 5-dimensional fractal bulk spacetime (Randall-Sundrum model). The fifth coordinate S represents physical scale — not an abstract parameter, but a real geometric coordinate.",
    "main_idea_text2": "The scale coordinate covers the entire range from the Planck scale (10⁻³⁵ m) to the Hubble scale (10²⁶ m), creating a fractal self-similar structure of spacetime. Exponential warping of the metric exp(−k|S|) naturally explains why gravity is 10³⁸ times weaker than the strong interaction.",
    "calculations_title": "📊 What is Calculated?",
    "calculations_text1": "All fundamental constants (G, α, α_s, G_F) are derived from a single geometric axiom without free parameters. Proton mass emerges automatically as a scale-suppressed Planck mass. Dark energy is explained by the drift of the global scale coordinate.",
    "calculations_text2": "The theory makes 27 testable predictions, 11 of which have already been confirmed by observational data (DESI 2025, Euclid, JWST, EHT). A key achievement is the explanation of evolving dark energy with a >4σ deviation from the standard ΛCDM model, which is consistent with SIFS predictions about scale coordinate drift.",
